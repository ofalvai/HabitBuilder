## Motivation

I needed a simple and minimal habit tracking app, so I decided to create my own.

This project is also a testing ground for new technologies I'd like to explore.

## Features

- Keep track of new habits and see your progress
- Statistics: aggregate and per-habit stats
  - Per-habit: completion rate, weekly and overall count, streaks
  - Overall: calendar heatmap, top habits, top days for habits
- Customizable habit list layout, reorderable list
- All data is persisted on-device in a database
- Export, import, archiving of old items

## ðŸ›  Built with

- [Compose-only](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) UI:
    - Based on Material3, supports dynamic color
    - Light and dark theme
    - Smooth and delightful animations
    - No AppCompat dependency, single Activity
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room): for storing data locally
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) + [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html): for async operations
- Testing:
    - Unit tests for most of the business logic (ViewModels, mappings, etc.)
    - Instrumented tests for DB operations
    - UI tests for some Compose screens
    - Kotlin Flow testing with [Turbine](https://github.com/cashapp/turbine)
- [Showkase](https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase): UI component browser in debug builds
- Other interesting bits and integrations:
    - Modular codebase according to best practices
    - [Gradle convention plugins](https://github.com/ofalvai/HabitTracker/tree/main/build-logic) for configuring modules
    - [Licensee](https://github.com/cashapp/licensee): 3rd party dependency validation, license report JSON for the Licenses screen
    - [Ruler](https://github.com/spotify/ruler): a Gradle plugin that measures app size and libraries contributing to it
    - [Gradle version catalog](https://github.com/ofalvai/HabitTracker/blob/main/gradle/libs.versions.toml)
    - [Renovate](https://github.com/ofalvai/HabitTracker/issues/10): Automating dependency update PRs (works with Gradle version catalogs!)
    - [Gradle dependency analysis](https://github.com/autonomousapps/dependency-analysis-android-gradle-plugin): For automatically detecting unused dependencies and other common mistakes

## Development

### Useful Gradle tasks

- `analyzeReleaseBundle`: Run Spotify Ruler
- `licenseeRelease`: Run license check and generate `app/build/reports/licensee/release/artifacts.json`, which should be copied over to `assets/licenses.json` for the Licenses screen
- `assembleRelease -Phabittracker.enableComposeCompilerReports=true`: Write Compose compiler metrics to `$module/build/compose_metrics`
- `buildHealth`: Run dependency analysis (looking for unused dependencies, incorrect module structure)
