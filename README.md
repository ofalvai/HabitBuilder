TODO

This project is also a testing ground for new technologies/libraries I'd like to test on a moderately complex project.

  - Overall: calendar heatmap, top habits, top days for habits
- Customizable habit list layout, reorderable list
- All data is persisted on-device in a database
- Onboarding hints, habit archive

## ðŸ›  Built with

- [Compose-only](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) UI:
    - Material You-ish design
    - Light and dark theme
    - Smooth and delightful animations
    - no AppCompat dependency, single Activity
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room): for storing data locally
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) + [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html): for async operations
- Testing:
    - Unit tests for most of the business logic (ViewModels, mappings, etc.)
    - Instrumented tests for DB operations
    - UI tests for some Compose screens
    - Kotlin Flow testing with [Turbine](https://github.com/cashapp/turbine)
- [Showkase](https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase): UI component browser in debug builds
- [Bugnsag](https://www.bugsnag.com/): Crash and error reporting
- Other interesting bits and integrations:
    - [Licensee](https://github.com/cashapp/licensee): 3rd party dependency validation, license report JSON for the Licenses screen
    - [Ruler](https://github.com/spotify/ruler): a Gradle plugin that measures app size and libraries contributing to it
    - [Gradle version catalog](https://github.com/ofalvai/HabitTracker/blob/main/gradle/libs.versions.toml)
    - [Renovate](https://github.com/ofalvai/HabitTracker/issues/10): Automating dependency update PRs (works with Gradle version catalogs!)

- `licenseeRelease`: Run license check, generate `app/build/reports/licensee/release/artifacts.json`, which should be copied over to `assets/licenses.json`
- `jacocoTestReport`: Generate test coverage (for unit tests)
